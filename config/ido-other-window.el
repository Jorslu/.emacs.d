;; This makes ido-find-file-other-window,
;; ido-switch-buffer-other-window, et. al obsolete. It’s a much better
;; abstraction, and I believe it should become apart of ido mode,
;; because any command that uses ido-completing-read can benefit from
;; it without any additional effort, including textmate.el’s
;; textmate-goto-symbol.
